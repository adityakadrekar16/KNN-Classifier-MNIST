## K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier from scratch

Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors classifier from scratch for image classification on MNIST dataset.
No existing sklearn packages were used for writing the knn code.

### Dataset
In MNIST dataset, each sample is a picture of a hand written digit. Each sample includes 28x28 grey-scale pixel values as features and a categorical class label out of 0-9. For more details, please refer to Dr. Yann Lecunâ€™s page (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The dataset has been imported using sklearn.dataset package.
